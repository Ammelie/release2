          For a few years now, I&#39;ve been trying out various educations and jobs in the intersection between technology and language.
          I&#39;ve worked as a tester, a translator and a bit of both during my time in localization testing.

          I&#39;m currently studying a 2 year long program in Front End Development at KYH in Stockholm, and look forward to my internship in spring 2018.
          During the internship, I&#39;ll finish my education while placed at a company.
